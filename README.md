# DerivedStats

The Derived Stats feature allows users to supply an expression to be evaluated as the value for a given statistic. (Rather than merely setting the value of the statistic as a simple scalar.) This expression is parsed and evaluated using a custom grammar and a parser generated by using the open source library [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4)

## Overview
Derived Stats is a new feature of a separate service which enables users to define new metrics (e.g. "stats") that are dependent upon existing metrics. 

The service supports simple arithmetic expressions, including aggregate functions such as SUM, MIN and MAX.

### Example:
We define a new derived stat: kill_ratio = kills / shots

Whenever the derived stat kill_ratio is desired, the values for "shots" and "kills" are retrieved, the expression "kills / shots" is evaluated and the result is returned.
